# worldcom

At first you need to create one database and add the name - "worldcom". You can choose other name too but in that case you need to change the database name in the database.php file. After creating the database you should run the "php migrations.php" command in the console which will create all the tables and insert initial data to there. 

After that you are ready to test the app. There are no submit button because when you add the zip code and choose the country Ajax call started to run and shows the right information.
